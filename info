# Task Description

In this task, the trainer method was used in the solution.

## Requirements

- Update the `Counter` component to take `onIncrement` and `onDecrement` callbacks as props and ensure they update the counter's values independently.

- Each callback should take a single integer value as a parameter, which is the amount to increment the counter's existing value by.

- Render a fourth `Counter` component and ensure its value is updated independently of the others.

- **Extra Credit**: Create a `Total` component, which should display below the `Counter` components and always display the running total of all the `Counter` values.

**Note: DO NOT USE FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS! USE CLASS COMPONENTS AND THEIR STATE.**
